**Memory Heiracrchy

5.1 Introduction
		unlimited, fast, illusion
		Temporal: items referenced recently will be referenced again
			MIPS will touch memory one __ times
		Spatial: items close to items referenced recently will be referenced
		heirarchy
	Cache Terminology
		two
			analogous to backpacks and getting things
		line/block
		hit
		miss
	More Terminology
		hit rate
		miss rate
		hit penalty
		miss penalty
		can pay a penalty even though you find it bc it pays to look
5.2 Memory Technologies
		Static (SRAM)
			takes same amount of time to access any item
			6 transitor cell, maintains value with power
		Dynamic (DRAM)
			1 transistor actings as a gate to a capacitor
			which means it has to be refreshed. time vs space

5.5 Dependable Memory Heiracrchy
		service delivered as specified
		service different from specified
		failures, restorations
		permananent, intermittent
		meant time to failure
		availability
	MTFF vs AFR for Disks
		written
	Availability considerations
		
	Single Error Detection - Parity
		bits, different
		parity
		
	Encoding Single Error Correcting Hamming Code
		1, left (or right but need to agree which way you're doing)
		power of 2, parity, 1,2,4,8,16 etc
			0 is the everything is good condition 
		3, 5 ,6, 7, 9 10, etc
		parity, data
		1, 0 (3, 5, 7, 9, 11....)
		2, 1 (3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15)
		4, 2 (5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15)
		8, 3 (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
		2^n, n
		parity, even
			parity is what we use to encode and check bits when decoding 
	Decoding Single Error Correcting Hamming Code
		Value, (check), in error
		encoding
		0000 indicated no error
		1010, 10
	Example
		written
	SEC/DED Hamming Code
		whole word
		4
		no error
		a correctable single error
		error occured in pn bit 
		double error
			#data bits = d
			#parity pits = p
			2^p >= p + d + 1

		4 Kilbytes, 16 kibytes, 32 Kibytes, 64 kilByte, 1 Kibytes
		fully associative 
		software
		back, through
	Virtual Memory Mapping
		indexes
			page offset: used to select particular item within the page you want
			18 bits of physical page number out of a 30 bit address
			Lookup table needed (2^20 possible page numbers = 1 MB)
		program, page table
		page table, start, page table
			page table register
		one level
		state, process, page table register, program counter, saved registers
	Page Faults
		replacement
		space on disk
		swap, space
		each virtual page, processes, virtual, physical
		least recently used
		
	The TLB
		tells us where to go to get what we want
		two, translation
		cache, recent
		translation lookaside buffer
		may, may not
			no mapping means page fault
			
		Characterstics
			fully associative
			1-2
			05-1
			10-100
			0.01-1%
		(Pages of page table come in and out of memory. Can be mapped to physical or disk)
		Would hope they were in physical, bc otherwise you have to go to a translation which can results in a page fault

		cache empty at startup
		can't hold them all
		map to the same place
		challenge, miss, negatively
	Finite state cache controll ER
		
	Two or more processors share an address space but have different values
	
	Snooping

	Concluding Remarks
		different block sizes
		lower level) farther away caches have time to implement strategies
		reorganizing program to inhance locality 
			example, rewrite matrix multiply
		prefecthing 
		speical cache aware instructions 
			can say don't wanna cache
