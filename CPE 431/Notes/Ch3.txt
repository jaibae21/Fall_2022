**Floating Point

3.1 Introduction
	interpreted 
	instruction
	signed, integer
	unsigned, integer 
	floating-point

3.5 Floating Point Basics
	scientific 
		1.xxxxxx * 2^yyyyy : x = fraction, y = exponent
		(-1)^2 : signed bit that doesn't contribute to the number itself
	range, precision 
		y , range
		x , precision 
	$0.10 : can't be represented exactly in binary so use BCD
	32 bits
	64 bits
	Special Cases: For 0: E and F are 0

	Decimal to IEEE FP (single precision)
		127 bias, leading 1 is implicit
		-0.75 = 0.11
		written
	
	Double Precision
		1023
	IEEE FP to Decimal (single precision)
		written
	Double Precision 
		written

3.6 Subword Parallelism
	color, position
	sounds
	subword, data transfer
	graphics, subword
	same operations, vectors
