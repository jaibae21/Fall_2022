***Pre-Class
Layout
	No need for hard-coded positions
	smooth, automatic resizing of windows
	
Signal Slot
	USer interaction with an on-screen widget is an event
	generic event handler event() may respond to any type of event
	specific event handlers respond to one type
	an event handler will excute and emit a signal, which will trigger excution of any connected slot functions in some order
	a signal emitted by a widget (object) indicates a user action (event) or state change
		one signal can be connected to multiple slots within an object or multiple slots across several different objects
		a signal can also be connected to another signal 
	a slot is a function that automatically excutes in response to connected signal that was emitted
		all slots connected to a signal are called when that signal is emitted
	Example 1:
		SIGNAL and SLOT must be used with QObject::connect()
	Example 2: 
		Qt5 style utilizes function pointers
	Overloading Signals/Slots
		changing text based on a slider
			need to identify signal emitted by QSlider to indicate a change in it's current setting
			valueChanged is emitted upon each change in current value 
				void valueChanged(int value)
			Qlabel's setText and setNum slots may change the current value displayed
				void setText(const QString& s)
				void setNum(int num)
				void setNum(double num)
			Assuming slider and label are pointers to QSlider and QLaber
				Qt4 style
					connect(ui->slider, SIGNAL(valueChanged(int)), ui->label, SLOT(setNum(int)));
				Qt5 style
					connect( ui->slider, &QSlider::valueChanged, ui->label, static_cast<void (QLabel::*)(int)>(&QLabel::setNum));
	To break existing signal-slot connection use disconnect in place of connect
	Custom Signals/Slot (example)
	
		
		
	
	
**In-Class
	we use QWidget
	.ui file is th drag and drop
	this refers to the memory address of W, or what you are currently referencing
	signals have a block with a little wifi like waves coming from it


Widget Programming
	Widget Pallete
		
	Object Viewer
		
	Property Editor
		Properties grouped by base classes within tree
		Object name: name of pointer variable used
		Font: change font properties
		Frame: add frame around a QLabel
		Text: allows you to alter text displayed within a QLabel or Pushbutton
	Layout Toolbar
		apply verticalbox, horizontalbox, grid etc
	
Modifying form Widget Properties via source code
	other than object name, these properties must be modified by source code
	each form has two components
		derived widget object
		formm object which is accessible via the ui pointer
		constructor initalizer places a valid address for the form in the ui pointer
	all widgests on the form are dynamically allocated by the statement ui->setup(this);
		holds the address of the form which delegates the memory for the widgets
		don't delete this statement
		don't attempt to access form widgets prior to execution of this statement 

Signal Slot Mechanism
	Object that experiences the event emits the signal
		many types of events
	slot functions that should execute in response to the event are triggered by the emitted signal 
	connect statement ties a signal emitted by an object to excution of a slot function
	disconnect may be used to break the connection between the signal and slot
	qt4 style uses macros SIGNAL and SLOT
	qt5 style uses function pointers
	
yes/no In class Example
	drag and drop form editor
	property editiing: renaming widget objects, font adjustment, etc
	layouts and spacers
	qt4 signal slot connection
	qt5 signal slot connection 
	qtDebug module and qDebug() output to console
