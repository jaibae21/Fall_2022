eventfitler 
	false will forward event
	true will not
	
files
	QFile myData ("data.txt")
	myData.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
	or
	mydata.setFileName
	
	can look at size, permissions, setPermissions, rename, remove, exists copy, or atEnd of file
	
	QDir allows relative or absolute path names
		standard is a / and qt will reinerpret for a machine 
		can also force qt to make the path absolute
		can do standard file type things such as returning to root, home, directory or cd into one 
	
	
	

**Event Handling
	Event Loop
		manages window events
		generates its own events
	QEvent base class of all events
	event handling options (preference order)
		reimplement specific event handler (different dedicated handlers for different types of events: key press, mouse click, timer, etc)
		reimplement generic event handler (QObject::event())
		use event filter on QObject (QObject::eventFilter())
		use event filter on QApplication object
		subclass QApplication and reimplement notify()
	Input/Output related Classes
		QIODevice is base class
		QFile is derived from QIODevice
		QDir provides access to directory structure and its contents
		Default looking place for input and output files
			local working subdirectory for the application (if created using QTCreator)
			normally within the build subdirectory for the application (QtCreator)
			within the source code subdirectory (command line)
	Stream abstraction interface
		provides I/O that resembles standard C++ file I/O
		QTextStream provides a convenient interface for reading and writing text to a QIODevice, QByteArray, QString
		QDataStream is encrypted (avoid using in this class)
